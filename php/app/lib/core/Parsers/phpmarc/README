This is a set of PHP classes for parsing and producing MARC data.
It reads and writes both MARC (z39.2) format records and records in a
mnemonic text format very similar to that used by Terry Reese's MarcEdit.
It has been used pretty extensively in a custom version of the OpenBiblio
automated library system (http://obiblio.sourceforge.net/) and will be
included in OpenBiblio 1.0.

There isn't really any documentation, but the tests in testMARC.php and
the example.php program should give you an idea of how it can be used.

Any feedback is appreciated!
